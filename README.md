Each .py file has an extensive README section at the very top of the file.
Please read it carefully to know what steps you must take to ensure the code runs properly.
Virtually every line has a comment accompanying it explaining what it is doing (and sometimes the reason why it is necessary).
Please report questions, bugs, or suggestions of any kind.
